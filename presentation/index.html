    <notes>We've got lot's to talk about, and I'm going to move through things quickly. I recommend you follow along here.</notes>
  </div>
  <div>Quick recap: <em>repositories</em></div>
  <div>Repositories are a collection of a project's code.</div>
  <div>
    They contain:
    <ul>
      <li>Commits</li>
      <li>Branches</li>
      <li>Source code</li>
      <li>Documentation</li>
      <li>Anything else required by your project</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    Repositories <em>do not</em> have to be local!
    <notes>And that's the crux of this presentation</notes>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>GitHub</li>
      <li>GitLab</li>
      <li>BitBucket</li>
      <li>and more...</li>
    </ul>
    <notes>These websites are the reason that open source programming exists. You host a repo online, and anyone in the world can learn from and contribute to the code. Also, these websites will come in handy for any group programming assignments.</notes>
  </div>
  <div>We'll be using <em>GitHub</em> for group projects.</div>
  <div class="blink">Get familiar with it!</div>

Even this presentation has a git repo! Notice GitHub adds a bunch of additional features. You have issues, project boards, a wiki. Also there is tonnes of additional software such as continuous integration and code quality tools
    </notes>
  </div>
  <div>So how do we actually contribute to GitHub repos?</div>
  <div>
    We have to <em>push</em> and <em>pull</em>.
    <notes>
In git, we say that each repository has two copies. We call these local and remote. Every contributor has their own local copy, and remote is treated as the master.
    </notes>
  </div>
  <div>
    <em>Pushing</em>: sending commits from your local repo to remote.
    <notes>You make changes, and you send them to the main repo for everyone else to see.</notes>
  </div>
  <div>
    <em>Pulling</em>: retrieving new commits from remote.
    <notes>It is a form of synchronisation. You're making sure that local and remote are in the same state. Note, draw a diagram on the board at this point, showing that each user has a local.</notes>
  </div>
  <div><em>Questions?</em> Before I move on...</div>
  <div>
    <em>Cloning!</em>
    <notes>Cloning is the act of copying a remote repository onto your computer.</notes>
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's do something <em>practical</em>
