  <div>Let's talk repositories ðŸš€</div>
  <div>Repositories are a collection of a project's code.</div>
  <div>
    They contain:
    <ul>
      <li>Commits</li>
      <li>Branches</li>
      <li>Source code</li>
      <li>Documentation</li>
      <li>Anything else required by your project</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Repositories <em>do not</em> have to be local!</div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>GitHub</li>
      <li>GitLab</li>
      <li>BitBucket</li>
      <li>and more...</li>
    </ul>
    <notes>
* Open source: host a repo online for everyone to see
 * You can host group assignments online for your team members to contribute to</notes>
  </div>
  <div>
    We'll be using <em>GitHub</em> for group projects.
    <notes>
For homework you can:
 * Get familiar with it!
 * Create an account
 * Join our organisation
 * Create a repo
    </notes>

    <notes>
Even this presentation has a git repo!
 * Notice GitHub adds a bunch of additional features. You have issues, project boards, a wiki
 * Also additional software such as continuous integration and code quality tools

  <div>So how do we actually contribute to them?</div>
  <div>
    We have to <em>push</em> and <em>pull</em>.
    <notes>
In git, there is a a notion of local and remote. Two copies of a repository. Every contributor has their own local copy, and remote is treated as the master.
    </notes>
  </div>
  <div>
    <em>Pushing</em>: sending commits from your local repo to remote.
    <notes>You make changes, and you send them to the main repo for everyone else to see.</notes>
  </div>
  <div>
    <em>Pulling</em>: retrieving new commits from remote.
    <notes>It is a form of synchronisation. You're making sure that local and remote are in the same state. Note, draw a diagram on the board at this point, showing that each user has a local.</notes>
  </div>
  <div><em>Questions?</em> Before I move on...</div>
  <div>
    <em>Cloning!</em>
    <notes>Cloning is the act of copying a remote repository onto your computer.</notes>
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's do something <em>practical</em>
