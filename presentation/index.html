    Welcome! ‚ù§Ô∏è
    <notes>
      So first of all, welcome.
    </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    We'll be discussing:
    <ul>
      <li>Taking your repo online</li>
      <li>Contributing to <em>open source</em> software</li>
      <li>And some practical stuff! üéâ</li>
    </ul>
    <notes>
      We've got lots to talk about, and I'm going to try and move through things relatively quickly. If I go too quickly, please someone stop me. Also feel free to ask questions at any time throughout this presentation.
    </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    A quick recap: <em>repositories</em>
  </div>

  <div>
    They contain:
    <ul>
      <li>Commits</li>
      <li>Branches</li>
      <li>Source code</li>
      <li>Documentation</li>
      <li>Other junk</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    Repositories <em>do not</em> have to be local!
    <notes>
      We can host them on the internet; and that's the crux of this presentation
    </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    There are some great websites for this:
    <ul>
      <li>GitHub</li>
      <li>GitLab</li>
      <li>BitBucket</li>
      <li>and more...</li>
    </ul>
    <notes>
      These websites are the reason that open source programming exists. You host a repo online, and anyone in the world can learn from and contribute to the code. Also, these websites will come in handy for any group programming assignments.
    </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    We'll be using <em>GitHub</em> for group projects.
    <notes>
      Voxel Engine is already hosted here.

      Even this presentation has a git repo! It's called GitGud.
      Notice GitHub adds a bunch of additional features. You have issues, project boards, a wiki. Also there is tonnes of additional software such as continuous integration and code quality tools. There is a lot to learn here.

  <div>
    Okay Sean, but <em>how do we contribute</em>?
  </div>

  <div>
    We have to understand <em>local</em> and <em>remote</em>.
  </div>

  <div data-background-image="images/local-and-remote.png">
    <notes>
      A local repo is a repository that is stored on your computer, and each contributor has one. There is then one remote, that is shared by everyone. This remote repo is considered the master.
    </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    <em>Push:</em> send commits from local to remote.
    <notes>
      Once you've made some changes on your local repo, you can push them to remote for everyone to see. You can push as often as you like, and in fact, I strongly recommend it.
    </notes>
  </div>

  <div data-background-image="images/pushing.png">
    <notes>
      Notice that pushing, does not automatically update every repo. Only the remote. 
      In the above example, we can see that I pushed some changes to remote, yet the other contributors are still only on version 1.0.
      This is a very important feature; it prevents changes that one contributor makes, from interrupting the changes of another contributor.
      So how do we solve this? How do the other contributors catch up to the remote?
    </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    <em>Pull:</em> retrieve new updates from remote.
    <notes>
      Pulling is a form of synchronisation. You're updating your local repo, to be more like remote.
    </notes>
  </div>

  <div data-background-image="images/pulling.png">
    <notes>
      Notice here that Jon has pulled, and his local repo is now up to date! We strongly recommend that you always pull before making changes to a repository. It simplifies things in the long run.
    </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    Questions?
    <notes>
      There's just one more thing to learn before we can do something practical.
    </notes>
  </div>


  <div>
    <em>Cloning!</em>
    <notes>
      Cloning involves copying a remote repository onto your computer.
    </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    Let's do something <em>practical</em> üéä
